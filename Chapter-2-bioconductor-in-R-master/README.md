# Chapter-2-bioconductor-in-R
Bioconductor collects numerous R packages for analysing, integrating and handling  high-throughput genomic data.
### Installing packages from Bioconductor
We have illustrate how to install packages into R. So I don't repeat here. Just get to the [Installing Libraries](https://github.com/Chengshu21/bio-start-with-R/blob/master/Chapter%201/Installing%20Libraries.md). 
### [Handling annotation databases in R](https://github.com/Chengshu21/Bioinformatics-with-R-cookbook/blob/master/Chapter-2-bioconductor-in-R-master/md/Handling%20annotation%20in%20R.r)
### [Performing ID conversions](https://github.com/Chengshu21/Bioinformatics-with-R-cookbook/blob/master/Chapter-2-bioconductor-in-R-master/md/2、ID%20Conversion.md)
### [The KEGG annotation and enrichment of genes](https://github.com/Chengshu21/Bioinformatics-with-R-cookbook/blob/master/Chapter-2-bioconductor-in-R-master/md/3、KEGG%20Annotation%20and%20Enrichment.md)
### [The GO annotation and enrichment of genes](https://github.com/Chengshu21/Bioinformatics-with-R-cookbook/blob/master/Chapter-2-bioconductor-in-R-master/md/4、GO%20Annotation%20and%20Enrichment.md)
