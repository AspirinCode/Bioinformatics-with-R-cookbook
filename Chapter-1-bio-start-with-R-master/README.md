# Chapter-1-bio-start-with-R
  The beginning of R in Bioinformatics (basic skill).<br>
  Before we learn something new, we should have a understanding of its introduction, history and goals and so on. Bioinformatics becomes a hot research topic in recent years. Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data. There are many informations about bioinformatics at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics). During understanding and mastering bioinfromatics, we use R (which provides a statistical tool and environment) to handle enormous data from experinments or other sources. R is a free tool with a large community and leverages the analysis of data via its huge package libraries that support various analysis operations.<br>
  I will start bioinformatics with the book, *Bioinformatics with R Cookbook，Paurush Praveen Sinha，June 2014*.
## The first week study:
### * [1、Installing Libraries](https://github.com/Chengshu21/Bioinformatics-with-R-cookbook/blob/master/Chapter-1-bio-start-with-R-master/MD/1、Installing%20Libraries.md)
